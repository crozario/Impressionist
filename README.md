# The Impressionist

Normally when you watch shows and movies, information only flows one way. From your television, computer or smartphone to you. **Impressionist changes this paradigm**. 
	
If you love a show or movie and want to do more than just watch it, if you’re watching friends or office or spongebob for the 5th time and you already know the words and punch lines, OR if you’re an ESL student and want to practice your fluency in a safe environment while having fun and learning essential idioms and pop culture references, **Impressionist** is for you. 

**Impressionist** will allow you to engage with your favorite flix. You can BE Oliver Queen; you can say “You have failed this city!”. You can BE Joey and say “How you doin’?”. The **Impressionist** will implement a fusion of current state-of-the-art in voice and deep learning technologies to compare your voice input to that of the artist. Foremost, it will check for accuracy by converting your speech to text and comparing it against original subtitles. Additionally, using open-source signal processing libraries, it will compare HOW you speak the dialogue. It will check paralinguistics such as tone, loudness, pitch, inflection, etc. and match to the actor’s. Finally, it will check if put your heart into the performance! Using deep learning, the emotion behind what you speak will be juxtaposed with the actor. 

Put simply, the better your *impression*, the more points you get. 

> **Impressionist** is like Karaoke but for movies and shows, and more interactive and awesome!
